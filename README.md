## Teachers / Professors Most Mind Our Own Business
#6 SPREADING SHIT ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK
> Complaining about you to other relatives, talking shit about you to your own friends, or spreading filth about you, and sometimes in quite a subtle or even humorous way, so you can’t really call it out, but the whole time they’re just lowering other people’s perceptions of you, so you’re left with nobody else to support you.

This is a very common manipulation technique that keeps you trapped with the parents and under their control because no-one else seems to be available to you.


## 2 UNFAIR COMPARISONS
Comparing you to someone in a specific area where the other person’s always better than you.

Like if you got second place in the race, “Why didn’t you get first?” even though you ran your best time ever.

“Your brother’s earning so much more than you,” even though he’s three years older and had more time to do it.

“Your sister is so much better than you because she’s got a boyfriend now,” even though her boyfriend is a dick.

This constant comparison to whatever you lack, and no matter what you do your parent finds somebody else to compare you to, somebody who’s doing better. This creates a sense that you’ll never be good enough.

## 3 FEAR FOR REPUTATION
Quite often, your parents are simply afraid. Maybe they see your “failures” (by their own judgmental standards) are somehow a reflection of their own inadequacies as parents. Everything that they don’t like about you they don’t like about themselves, and so there’s this fear that you represent them.

Maybe it’s even quite literal, like they don’t want their church to see how “bad” you are as a kid or else their snooty friends will think they raised a bad Christian. They might be afraid that your behaviour will somehow reflect on them negatively, and they try to control you to avoid that judgment on them, especially if they’re very judgmental and they’ve received a lot of judgment in their life.

If they come from a very harshly judgmental community or family background themselves (e.g. conservative and religious), their reputation will be a big deal to them and you’ll be directly responsible (in their eyes) for that reputation.
